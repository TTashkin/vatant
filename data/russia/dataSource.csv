Russia,2010,A,6,Ethnic,2010,A,6,,,,Y,Y,Y,,"2010 census data over the 2021 census because, although many people intentionally gave misleading data, it was not to the extent of inaccuracies in the 2021 census, where hundreds of thousands did not answer. The census counted foreigners and refugees but it is unlikely all foreigners and refugees answered because of a history of Russian government use of census results politically and to make arrests."
