                <h3>About Vatant</h3>
                <p id="boxInfo">This project began in the Middle East, as many things in the world have.</p>
                </p>As a politics and history buff, I have always wondered how differently the world could have turned out, or what changes can happen.
                Maps have always been the source of my love for history, so for years it has been my dream to be able to twist reality and change the past, present, and future.
                This project, of collecting and inferring data from around the globe, began in the summer of 2023, and while
                this website was created to in one way collect and organize data in general, 
                it more importantly is supposed to get people thinking beyond borders that were set a century ago, and imagine something beyond them.
                </p>
